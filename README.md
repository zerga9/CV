Hi! I'm a Ruby on Rails developer. I love coding because I get to build meaningful tools, work in a team, solve challenging problems and keep on learning new skills for ever and ever and ever.

## Background

I studied Medicine and Philosophy and then became a self-taught video editor working on social and cultural projects.
Although liking all the things I've done, my passion for technology and problem solving motivated me to learn programming.
In June 2018, I graduated from Makers Academy's 12 week course and soon after began working for BitPesa. There I am part of a team maintaining various apps for foreign exchange and payment to and from frontier markets (mostly in Africa)

## Skills

#### Clean, clear code

During Makers Academy I understood why it is so important to follow best practice in coding.
By doing so you develop maintainable, solid and tested programs. Since then I have applied this discipline when creating new projects and working with legacy code. I make sure that naming and abstraction are always thought through

#### Learner

I enjoy challenging myself with new topics and new ways of learning, hence my varied career path and the move to Software Development

#### Problem-solver

While studying Philosophy I fell in love with logic: how to check arguments by critical analysis, reasoning and reflection.
I was later drawn to coding for its problem-solving element, and how at first seemingly impossible problems can be solved through clean coding practices.

#### Communication

As Project Co-ordinator at Cineac TV I was promoting our programme, finding local volunteers and teaching them to film, interview and edit programmes about their local community. I managed 15 volunteers from diverse backgrounds for over four years. http://www.cineac.tv

#### Teaching

As Video Workshop Leader for primary and secondary school children learning interview techniques, filming and editing skills. http://www.stichtinghoedjevanpapier.nl/

#### Other Skills

Final Cut Pro (fully proficient)
Fluent in English, Dutch and Arabic (Moroccan)
