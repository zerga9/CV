A full-stack developer and Makers Academy Fellowship graduate.
I have a passion for problem solving, enjoy working in a team, learning new skills and creating visually appealing products using clean and dry code.

I studied Medicine and Philosophy. Became a self taught video editor and then a project manager for a TV station, a video workshop leader at secondary schools and a support worker in a home for young people with mental health problems and learning disabilities and then a mother.

## Skills

#### Communication

As Project Co-ordinator at Cineac TV (the Netherlands) I was responsible for promoting our broadcast, finding local volunteers, engaging them with our project and teaching them to film, interview and edit programmes about their local community. I managed 15 volunteers from diverse backgrounds and monitored their development over four years. http://www.cineac.tv

#### Teaching

As Video Workshop Leader for 'Stichting Hoedje van Papier' I taught primary and secondary school children interview techniques, filming and editing skills to make short video films about their neighbourhood. http://www.stichtinghoedjevanpapier.nl/

#### Organisational Skills

The project for Cineac TV was overseen and funded by the Rotterdam City Council. I had to deliver a detailed project plan with budget at the beginning of each year which needed to be accounted for when the year was over. My project management had to be rigorous and those skills I have found to be readily transferable.
We had standups in the morning and at the end of the day we had a retro. The team was working in pairs to make objective items about their neighbourhood
